# Release v1.12.1: Bugfix for Change Simulation

**Release Date**: 2024-12-16

## 🐛 Bug Fix

### Missing `list_workflows` Method

**Issue**: The `simulate_workflow_changes` and `analyze_change_impact` tools failed with error:
```
AttributeError: 'N8nClient' object has no attribute 'list_workflows'
```

**Root Cause**: The change simulation system calls `n8n_client.list_workflows()` to fetch all workflows for downstream impact analysis, but the N8nClient only had `get_workflows()`.

**Fix**: Added `list_workflows()` method as alias to `get_workflows()` in `client.py`:
```python
async def list_workflows(self, active_only: bool = False) -> List[Dict]:
    """Alias for get_workflows - used by change simulation"""
    return await self.get_workflows(active_only)
```

## ✅ Affected Tools Now Working

- ✅ `simulate_workflow_changes` - Full terraform-style change preview
- ✅ `analyze_change_impact` - Multi-dimensional impact analysis

Both tools now correctly fetch all workflows to analyze downstream impact.

## 📦 Changes

**Modified Files**:
- `src/n8n_workflow_builder/client.py` - Added `list_workflows()` alias method
